# TUI Musement Interview Test

This is a repository containing the solution produced by Nico Luisetto to the TUI Musement Interview Test described at [this link](https://gist.github.com/hpatoio/3aeea8159fb9046a2feba75d39a8d21e).

The test is composed of two steps, the repository folder structure is organized around those two steps:

- [step_1](step_1) contains the source code of the CLI application and the unit tests, see the related [README.md](step_1/README.md) for more information.
- [step_2](step_2) contains the specification of the API endpoints intended to store and retrieve weather forecasts, see the related [README.md](step_2/README.md) for more information.
