# TUI Musement Weather Forecasts store APIs specification

API specifications are provided as:
- an [OpenAPI 2.0 json document](./api_specs.json) authored on [Apicurio Studio](https://www.apicur.io/)
- an HTML document generated from the OpenAPI specifications using [Redoc-cli](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc#redoc-cli)

If specifications are not clear enough or I missed something, drop me a message and we'll plan a refinement session as soon as possible.
